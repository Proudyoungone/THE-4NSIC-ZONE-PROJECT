## Notes
-On the homepage, you’ll notice-
 
✅ GitHub hall of fames and a live activity section from repositories.

-Chip ID Framework was built to assist anyone that is faces with the difficult task of identifying a flash memory chip. Filter down to find possible matches to what you are looking for.

-Resources combines my start.me page along with Frank Mazzola’s start.me page. Resources contains information such as-

 ✅ law enforcement request portals
 ✅ training sites (vendors and academies)
 ✅ and other helpful links relating to investigations

-Tools is the page with many categories of tool, each with:

 ✅ descriptions
 ✅ supported platforms
 ✅ license information
 ✅ and links to take you to the tool itself

And finally, my personal favorite, the playbook page. This page contains basic helpful uses of CMD and PowerShell with categories and descriptions, as well as safe practices at the end of each tabbed list.

I hope this is helpful. I’d love to hear any critiques or general feedback. I am still very new. AI did do a lot of the heavy lifting with coding along with the catalogs, but it taught me different code and how to use them. 

I also want to give a huge shoutout to Justin Nordine who developed OSINT Framework for letting me use his structure and providing me with some guidance. You can find OSINT Framework at the following link: https://osintframework.com/
